Lab notes for the courses Advanced Physics Lab I (Fall 2020) and Advanced Physics Lab II (Spring 2021) at Jacobs University Bremen.

## Advanced Physics Lab I
- <b>Dynamics of Rotational Motion</b><br>
The polar moment of inertia of a gyroscope was determined using geometric data, energy conservation with falling mass, precession and nutation.

- <b>Ultrasonic Waves</b><br>
The properties of ultrasonic soundwaves like bandwidth, superposition, beating phenomenon, sound velocity and diffraction were studied using a piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer.

- <b>Thermal and Electrical Conductivity</b><br>
The thermal and electrical conductivities of copper, aluminium and iron were determined and Wiedemann-Franz law was tested.

- <b>Hall effect</b><br>
Charge transport in semiconductor p-Ge and metal Cu was investigated by charge carrier analysis
in a magnetic field via Hall effect and by conductivity measurements.

- <b>Polarization of Visible Light</b><br>
The properties of polarized light were investigated. Tasks: confirmation of Malus law; determination of Fresnel reflection coefficients and Brewster angle for glass; conversion between linearly and elliptically polarized light.

- <b>Solar Cell</b><br>
The performance of a multi-crystalline silicon solar cell was studied for different temperatures, light intensity and light composition. Performance metrics like efficiency, fill factor and maximum generated power were determined from current-voltage characteristic.

- <b>Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)</b><br>
The specific electron mass was determined using a special cathode ray tube called teltron tube and SEM was operated to obtain magnified images of different specimen using electron beam.
